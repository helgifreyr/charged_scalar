Im(w) as a function of r_m
  there is a r_m^{crit} for which Im(w)<0 if r_m<r_m^{crit}
  increasing Q increases r_m^{crit}, there is a Q<1.0 that depends on q and mu, that gives the maximum value of abs(Im(w))*
  increasing q decreases r_m^{crit}, higher abs(Im(w))
  increasing \mu decreases r_m^{crit}, lower abs(Im(w))
Im(w) as a function of q/\mu
  there is a q_{crit} for which Im(w)<0 if q<q_{crit}
  increasing Q decreases q_{crit}
  increasing \mu increases q_{crit}
  increasing r decreases q_{crit}


* for \mu = 0.2, this changes between Q=0.95 and Q=0.99 somewhere between q=0.4 and q=0.5. very close to q=0.5**
  for \mu = 0.1,                                                          q=0.2 and q=0.25. closer to q=0.25
  so it probably depends on the ratio? could be a curve Q vs q/\mu that will always be a maximum

** at this point, the maximum was almost equal for Q=0.95 and Q=0.99, i tried plotting Q=0.975 and get an even higher maximum.
